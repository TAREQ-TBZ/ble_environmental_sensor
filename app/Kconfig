config MEASURING_PERIOD_SECONDS
    int "Sampling period for temperature and humidity measurements (in seconds)"
    default 30
    help
        Defines how frequently the sensor samples temperature and humidity data. Adjust this value to balance between data freshness and power consumption.

config FIRST_MEASUREMENT_DELAY_SECONDS
    int "Delay before the first measurement after device startup (in seconds)"
    default 10
    help
        Specifies the time to wait after booting before taking the initial measurement. This allows the device to stabilize before collecting data.

config MIN_ADV_INTERVAL_MS
    int "Minimum Bluetooth advertisement interval (in milliseconds)"
    default 500
    help
        Defines the shortest time interval between two consecutive Bluetooth advertisement packets. 
        A lower value increases advertisement frequency, improving device discoverability but consuming more power.

config MAX_ADV_INTERVAL_MS
    int "Maximum Bluetooth advertisement interval (in milliseconds)"
    default 501
    help
        Defines the longest time interval between two consecutive Bluetooth advertisement packets.
        A higher value reduces power consumption but may slow down connection establishment.
